# MongoDB - Detroit Become Webscale

## Disclaimer

This article explicitly exists to share my process of learning nosql as someone who has only ever used sqlite and postgres.
<br>I am by no means a source of truth or reliable narrator.

## Immediately noticable differences:

- What did they do to the `JOIN` keyword I miss her :(
- It seems to be much more ok interoping with backend code for complicated mutations instead of cramming the vast majority of logic into sql functions / views / parameterized queries
- I'm not a fan of writing queries using JSON syntax (this could grow on me)
- I kinda like the lack of migrations but the implications scare me
-
